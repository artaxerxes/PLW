Why MATLAB/linux is crashing everytime, complaining some MEX problem? DotRotDemo() is not crashing it, Octave/GNU is not, neither...and Windows MATLAB is just all right

c36e8bae1319d5a461b06fe8770f582175319ae8 introduced many data for 
SimpleTask experiment, for both its main experiment and its baseline experiment.
But for its baseline experiment, the data .mat files does not have a _Simple_ within data file name, 
as they should have. Load and check the .mat files to see if they are generated 
from PLWTactileBaseInOutSimple.m, or one of PLWTactileBase2InOut.m/PLWTactileBase2.m

They are used by coresponding analysis code (simple), which quite surely certifies that their usage is all right.
