.mat files are either in the format nameD.mat or in nameM.mat;
nameD.mat: Direction tasks, responding to the seen PLW.
nameM.mat: Number of the dots task, responding to the number of the dots,
  respond RIGHT if most of the dots seen is RED. The experiment in theis
  case is controlled via "mode.many_on=1"

log: the last two data has some important issue. The wangchongM*.mat and 
chenqifanM*.mat was under different task due to the experimenter's mistake.
Before many_on experiment, they were told to RESPOND "LEFT" TO MANY OF THE 
"RED" DOTS, which is:  MANY RED--> LEFT
         unlike this:  MANY RED--> RIGHT (this is what it should have been.)

  adjust these two *D.mat files!
  Files with these issues are:
chenbiqingM01-Dec-2012.mat
liuchenglongM01-Dec-2012.mat
majieM01-Dec-2012.mat
ChenQifanM17-Nov-2012.mat
wangchongM17-Nov-2012.mat
